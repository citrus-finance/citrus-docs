## Treasury

All fees collected by Citrus products will be redirected to the Treasury. The Treasury will then exchange those tokens for Citrus stablecoin. The stablecoin tokens collected will then be distributed to the dev teams through grants and to proportionally to $CTRS holders.

## Sink and Faucet

Citrus protocol aim is to support as many chains as possible, for this reason we decided to have our own stablecoin so we can apply a Sink and Faucet startegy when collecting fees and distribute earnings.

### Sink

Every Citrus stablecoin token we collect as fee will be burned. They will be removed from circulation so that they can be re-emited later on.

### Faucet

Every Citrus stablecoins we burn are tracked and are minted back to $CTRS stakers, so they can earn protocol fees on any chains they choose to stake
