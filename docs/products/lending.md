# Lending

Citrus Lending platform is a fork of Rari Fuse and Compound V2, it's aim it to allow anyone to create their market pool. Lending markets are very tricky and error prone to operate, so we will give pool owners the appropriate tools to manage theirs in a secure manner. Users will also be able to see how secure is that pool by checking the oracle it's using, its upgrade mechanism and more.
