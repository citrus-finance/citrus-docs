# Vault

Vault is a code product of the ecosystem. The goal is to integrate it to most of our other products so that any unused funds can generate yields.

The goal of the Vault product is to allow anyone to build their own vaults and present it to our users so they can deposit their funds on them. We intent to do that by providing building blocks that any third-party developer can use, ensuring as much flexibility as possible while managing risks.

The first version of Vault will be solely a front-end interface interacting with highly trusted thrird-party ERC4626.


### Status

Some vaults are already available for you to use on some chains. Our focus is to list highly trusted third party vaults. The next step will be to build our own vault, then to allow anyone to build their vaults.

Allowing anyone to build their own vaults is a complex endeavor and will take time.
